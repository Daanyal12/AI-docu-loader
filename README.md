# AI Document loader using Langchain

In this Project we were tasked with developing a document loader that can process company data and allow a user to make quries on it, for this project we had to use a frame work called langchain
what this framework does is it allows you the developer to chain together agents and LLMs to help you build various different things that require an AI model, this technology makes it very helpfull when
developing such complex programs as it gives you features such as Document loaders, text splitters, vector data bases, conversational buffer memory and more which all gets tied together by the conversation chain.
