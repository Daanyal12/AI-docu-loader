1.4 Strategic Analysis 

The strategic planning of a business involves the analysis of a firm’s internal and external factors to better understand its’ long-term organizational effectiveness.  The business environment is one that is dynamic, ever-changing, and always at a constant flux due to the presence of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity). In the face of VUCA, organizations like Clickatell need to ensure that decision-making is centered around the use of evidence, in the form of data, statistics and objective information to guide strategic decisions. Strategic decisions are complex, high risk and impact the overall shareholders and stakeholders of the business. Researchers iterate the importance of strategic planning and the setting of clear goals which are closely linked towards improving organizational performance. 

The management tools that will be used to analyze Clickatell’s market and/or competitive landscape include the SWOT framework, comprising of in-depth analysis of the opportunities and threats using the Porter’s Five Forces Framework as well as the PESTEL analysis. The report will further provide general recommendations to tackle issues. 

2. SWOT Analysis

SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is a framework used to evaluate a company's competitive position and to develop strategic planning. SWOT analysis assesses internal and external factors, as well as current and future potential. The “Strengths” and “Weaknesses” components of the framework are considered an internal matter for the organization and “Opportunities” and “Threats” are related to the external environment that can be exploited as they may lead to problems for the entire organization if not well utilized or monitored.

There are several studies that confirm the SWOT analysis as one of the most widely used strategy tools amongst managers or individual firms. The SWOT analysis may well be used more than other management techniques in the process of decision making. There has been little attention given to understanding the social and institutional context which shaped the historical evolution of the SWOT framework. Below is the analysis of the 4 key areas of the SWOT framework for Clickatell.

2.3 PESTLE Analysis
Despite being a renowned organisation, Clickatell still operates in an environment that comprises of external forces, this requires the company to constantly scan the environment in which they operate to gain all the necessary information regarding the trends (both current and upcoming), events and relationships they have within the operating environment. 

Therefore, a PESTEL analysis framework is discussed herein to assess Clickatell’s strengths and weaknesses on a macro level. The PESTEL framework is used due to its comprehensive macro-environmental analytical capabilities, focusing on the Political, Economic, Technological, Environmental, Legal and Ethical factors that can have a direct impact on the business. 

The macro-environment factors can impact the Porter Five Forces that shape strategy and competitive landscape. They can impact individual firm’s competitive advantage or overall profitability levels of the Technology industry. This is why a market environment analysis will be conducted for Clickatell using Porter’s five forces to assess its competitive landscape against competitors. 

PESTEL analysis provides great detail about the operating challenges Clickatell will face in prevalent macro environment other than competitive forces. For example, an Industry may be highly profitable with a strong growth trajectory, but it won't be any good for Clickatell if it is situated in unstable political environment.

Political factors that impact Clickatell
Political factors play a significant role in determining the factors that can impact Clickatell's long term profitability in a certain country or market. Clickatell is operating in chat commerce in more than dozen countries and expose itself to different types of political environment and political system risks. Clickatell can closely analyze the following factors before entering or investing in a certain market-

· Political stability and importance of chat commerce in the country's economy.
· Risk of military invasion.
· Level of corruption - especially levels of regulation in Technology sector.
· Bureaucracy and interference in chat commerce and application software industry by government.
· Legal framework for contract enforcement
· Intellectual property protection.
· Trade regulations & tariffs related to Technology.
· Favored trading partners.
· Anti-trust laws related to Application Software
· Pricing regulations – Are there any pricing regulatory mechanism for Technology?
· Taxation - tax rates and incentives.
· Wage legislation - minimum wage and overtime.
· Work week regulations in Application Software.
· Mandatory employee benefits.
· Industrial safety regulations in the Technology sector.
· Product labeling and other requirements in Application Software.

Economic factors that impact Clickatell
The Macro environment factors such as – inflation rate, savings rate, interest rate, foreign exchange rate and economic cycle determine the aggregate demand and aggregate investment in an economy. While microenvironment factors such as competition norms impact the competitive advantage of the firm. Clickatell can use country’s economic factor such as growth rate, inflation & industry’s economic indicators such as Chat Commerce and Application Software industry growth rate, client/end-user spending etc. to forecast the growth trajectory for the sector and the organization. Economic factors that Clickatell should consider while conducting PESTEL analysis are –
· Economic growth rate
· Discretionary income
· Unemployment rate
· Inflation rate
· Interest rates
· Skill level of workforce in Development/Application Software industry.
· Education level in the economy
· Labor costs and productivity in the economy
· Business cycle stage (e.g. prosperity, recession, recovery)
· Type of economic system in countries of operation – what type of economic system there is and how stable it is.
· Government intervention in the free market and related Technology
· Exchange rates & stability of host country currency.
· Efficiency of financial markets – Does Clickatell needs to raise capital in local market?
· Infrastructure quality in Application Software industry
· Comparative advantages of host country and Technology sector in the particular country

Social Factors that Impact Clickatell
Society’s culture and way of doing things impact the culture of an organization in an environment. Shared beliefs and attitudes of the population play a great role in how marketers at Clickatell will understand the clients of a given market and how they design the marketing message for Chat commerce and Application Software industry consumers. Social factors that leadership of Clickatell should analyze for PESTEL analysis are –
  
· Demographics and skill level of the population (in this case we know that Clickatell is a B-2-B company and demographics don’t take priority).
· Class structure, hierarchy and power structure in the society.
· Education level as well as education standard in Clickatell’s industry.
· Culture (gender roles, social conventions, reactions new technology)
· Entrepreneurial spirit and broader nature of the society. Some societies encourage entrepreneurship while some don’t.
· Attitudes (health, environmental consciousness, etc.)
· Leisure interests.

Technological factors that impact Clickatell
Technology is fast disrupting various industries across the board. The transportation industry is a good case to illustrate this point. Over the last 5 years, the industry has been transforming really fast, not even giving chance to the established players to cope with the changes. The taxi industry is now dominated by players like Uber, Bolt, and In-Driver. The car industry is fast moving toward automation led by technology firm such as Google & manufacturing is disrupted by Tesla, which has stated an electronic car revolution. 

A business should not only do technological analysis of the industry but also the speed at which technology disrupts that industry. Slow speed will give more time while fast speed of technological disruption may give a company little time to cope and be profitable. Technology analysis involves understanding the following impacts –

· Recent technological developments by Clickatell competitors (as observed with some WhatsApp Business features from our biggest competitors above).
· Technology's impact on product offering.
· Impact on cost structure in Chat commerce and Application Software industry.
· Impact on value chain structure in technology sector.
· Rate of technological diffusion.

Environmental Factors that Impact Clickatell
Different markets have different norms or environmental standards which can impact the profitability of an organization in those markets. Even within a country, often, states or provinces can have different environmental laws and liability laws. For example in United States – Texas and Florida have different liability clauses in case of mishaps or environmental disaster. Similarly a lot of European countries give healthy tax breaks to companies that operate in the renewable sector.

Before entering new markets or starting a new business in existing market the firm should carefully evaluate the environmental standards that are required to operate in those markets. Some of the environmental factors that a firm should consider beforehand are –

· Weather.
· Global Pandemics (as observed with Covid-19 which shifted Clickatell operations to a Hybrid mode, with most employees continuing to work remotely. Working remotely includes certain costs for the company, including communication, productivity etc. This therefore calls for Clickatell to always be prepared for natural disasters to not only remain afloat but to also ensure that the level of service provided to clients remains the same despite working remotely or from office)
· Wars (Ukraine Vs Russia war which not only affected those countries but a lot of countries including South Africa, causing interest rates drastic increase and so forth)
· Climate change.
· Laws regulating environment pollution.
· Air and water pollution regulations in Application Software industry.
· Recycling.
· Waste management in Technology sector.
· Attitudes toward “green” or ecological products.
· Endangered species.
· Attitudes toward and support for renewable energy.

Legal Factors that Impact Clickatell
In number of countries, the legal framework and institutions are not robust enough to protect the intellectual property rights of an organization. A firm should carefully evaluate before entering such markets as it can lead to theft of organization’s secret sauce thus the overall competitive edge. Some of the legal factors that Clickatell leadership should consider while entering a new market are –

· Anti-trust law in Application Software industry and overall in the country.
· Discrimination law.
· Copyright, patents / Intellectual property law (as Clickatell has done with Chat2Pay in respective countries).
· Consumer protection and e-commerce.
· Employment law.
· Health and safety law.
· Data Protection (as Clcikatell continuously does with Cybersecurity training and webinars).


2.4 Threats (Porter’s Five Forces Framework)

In this section the market environmental analysis for Clickatell is conducted using Porter’s five forces namely, threat of the new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes and rivalry amongst competitors. These five forces provide organizations with understanding of strategic implications within the industry as emphasized by Porter. The image gives a brief overview of what each force entails.

Pricing strategy is not straight forward​. Basis for pricing varies across competitors. Customers may find it difficult to compare prices​ due to regional variation in pricing.
The bargaining power of suppliers is high due to Clickatell and competitors being highly dependent on them for raw materials. The main suppliers include Meta, WhatsApp, AWS etc.
Competitors have substituted Clickatell’s Chat2Pay with WhatsApp pay. 
Threat of new entrants is high for Clickatell, with the WhatsApp Business due to ease with which companies can set it up, several number of businesses have joined the chat commerce. industry in the recent years to compete for market share with WhatsApp being used as the main channel to connect businesses with their customers.
Switching costs are very low for buyers thus making it easy for them to switch service providers.



2.3.1 Threats of New Entrants- High
Threats of new entrants refer to the ability of a company to enter the industry. High barriers prevent a new company entering the industry. There are two factors that need to be assessed when evaluating the threat of new entrants, how attractive the growth & profit prospects are for new entrants and if the new entrants resource & capabilities lower the barrier to entry. Barriers to entry include: -
·  Product differentiation: A new entrant looking to compete in an industry must bring a highly unique product/service to market in order to succeed. 
· Cost disadvantages: Existing companies with large customer bases are able to utilize economies of scale to offer their products or services at a lower cost than new companies. Companies can achieve economies of scale by increasing production and lowering costs. This happens because costs are spread over a larger number of goods.
· Capital requirements: There is a high fixed cost to entering a new industry. 
· Access to distribution channels: Existing companies control supply chains and distribution channels and have easy access to raw materials. 
· Switching costs: Customers pay a price for switching from one company to another. Switching costs can deter customers from leaving an existing company for a new one. 
· Government policy: Government policy may regulate a company’s operations and require licenses and permits in order to enter an industry. 


2.3.2 Bargaining Power of Suppliers – High
• The number of suppliers in the industry are not too many, main suppliers are Meta, WhatsApp, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google.
• Product offering is the same, pricing offering differs according to how each client uses the suppliers platform.
• Limited uniqueness of supplier product offering.
• It is within each client’s power to ensure that the product is designed and priced in a manner that makes it hard for competitors to substitute

2.3.3 Bargaining Power of Buyers - High
• The bargaining power of buyers assesses how easy it is for customers to reduce prices. The bargaining power of buyers is perceived to be high for Clickatell, this is despite Clickatell being a B-2-B company. 
• Switching cost and effort is relatively low. 
• Clients negotiating with competitors for the best price forces Clickatell to lower the prices as much as they can to gain and retain more clients, while avoiding clients being easily poached by competitors for their lowest prices.

2.3.4 Threat of Substitutes - High
This refers to “the core product being able to be substituted with either quality or price. This force assesses the quality and nature of the product, and the price sensitivity of the customers. This force investigates the ease at which the customer can switch the product”. Furthermore, it also speaks to the unique selling point of the organisation.

Lack of differentiation or low switching costs lead to rivalry where there is high level of price competition.

• Several competitors such as Infobip, Messagebird, Twilio, LivePerson, CM.com, Messenger People, Interakt, Haptik, Apex and WATI who fall under the top 10 due to product offering and pricing plan similarity as well as exposure could potentially cause rivalry amongst each other.
• Competitors are highly concentrated in the industry with high brand awareness and high revenue.
• Diversity of competitors is high, e.g. multiple industries served.
• Competitors drastic growth in the industry despite their not so many years being functional.
• No barriers to exit for clients.
• No switching costs to change service providers.
These are the factors that could potentially lead to rivalry amongst competitors due to the same industries where each company sources clients, and the fact that all of the competitors also have a global exposure.
